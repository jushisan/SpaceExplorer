SpaceExplorer
=============

A Java program written from scratch to simulate the 3D space, and allows users to explore the space through the view of a spaceship.

To begin, users may input the number of stars they would like to appear in the space. 
To explore the space, we control the spaceship as follows:
				- press up to move the spaceship forward
				- press left to rotate the spaceship counter-clockwise
				- press right to rotate the spaceship clockwise
				- drag the mouse to change the direction of the spaceship
